# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end
# db/seeds.rb

# Create initial organizations
# organizations = [
#   { name: 'Organization A' },
#   { name: 'Organization B' },
#   { name: 'Organization C' }
# ]

# organizations.each do |org_data|
#   Organization.create!(org_data)
# end

# Organization.find_each do |organization|
#   User.create!(
#     email: "admin@#{organization.name.downcase.gsub(' ', '')}.com",
#     password: 'password',
#     is_admin: true
#   )
